1. are there users in the profile?
2. record types active vs not active
3. records created for particular record type -> select count() from account 
    - Have to be objects level

    async function testing_recordsquery(){
   // let result =  conn.query("select count() from account where recordtype = 'Account'")
    conn.query("SELECT count() FROM Account where recordtypeid = '012460000011jC3AAI'", function(err, result) {
        if (err) { return console.error(err); }
        console.log("total : " + result.totalSize);
        console.log("fetched : " + result.records.length);
      });
    //console.log(result);
}

For point 3, need background svc for this.

4. License Usage

- DONE
5. Org type - find org type
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_limits.htm

6. Apex Pages 
- When it was last modified

SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate FROM ApexTrigger order by Lastmodifieddate desc

SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate FROM ApexClass order by Lastmodifieddate desc

async function testing_getApexPageByLastModified(){
    conn.query("SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate FROM ApexPage order by Lastmodifieddate desc", function (err, result){
        if (err) { return console.error(err); }
        console.log(result);
        console.log("fetched : " + result.records.length);
    });
}





My solution was to use metadata files for profiles.

Get access to Salesforce metadata. You can do this using the metadata API directly, or indirectly through pulling metadata files via an IDE like Eclipse or MavensMate

Get metadata for profiles and for layouts. The layouts metadata provides you a full list of page layouts across all objects, while the profile files contain the info on which page layout/record type combos the profile is associated with.

Compare the profiles' assignments to page layouts to the list of page layouts. I did this using some scripting code which parsed through the xml files.
